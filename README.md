## Creating a Fully Managed Hadoop Ecosystem with Google Cloud Dataproc (Digital Innovation One Project)
Project was taught by instructor Marcelo Marques (https://github.com/marcelomarques05/dio-desafio-dataproc)

I changed the code to:
1) Count the words of a book and inform the top 10 words used (result folder) 
2) Count the words of a Thor Ragnarok script and save file with the last 20 words used (result_script folder)

Objectives:
* Explore Google Cloud Platform
* Create a cluster
* Create bucket in Cloud Storage
* Use terminal to modify, copy and transfer files
* Perform data processing using the GCP Dataproc product
* Run a PySpark Job
